# My Anime Picks 🍿

Hey there! Welcome to my first big web project. This is a stylish, responsive anime recommendation website I built from scratch to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

I'm a first-year student, and this project was my way of taking all the theory—like flexbox, gradients, and hover effects—and turning it into something real and fun.

## ✨ Features

I tried to pack in as many modern web features as I could:

* **Glassmorphism Nav:** A sticky, blurred navigation bar that stays with you as you scroll.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Clicking a nav link will glide you smoothly to that section.
* **Dropdown Menus:** Clean, CSS-only dropdowns for a better user experience.
* **Stylish Hero:** A big, bold hero section to grab your attention.
* **CSS Grid Layout:** A responsive grid for all the anime cards.
* **Cool Hover Effects:** Check out the anime cards and buttons! They lift up and glow when you hover over them.
* **Fully Responsive:** (Well, I'm trying!) It should look good on mobile devices, too.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is a testament to what you can do with the basics. No frameworks, no libraries—just pure, old-school (but stylish!) web fundamentals.

* **HTML5:** For all the structure.
* **CSS3:** For all the style, from the `linear-gradient` background to the `backdrop-filter` and `box-shadow` effects.

## 👉 Acknowledgment

This was a learning project, so a huge thank you to all the online tutorials and docs that helped me figure out the tricky parts (looking at you, dropdown menus and sticky navs!).

Hope you find a new anime to binge!
